										<h2>What sets us apart</h2>	

										<p>We realize that choosing an orthodontist is a big decision for most families, and with so 

many orthodontists around, how do you decide which is best for you?</p>
										<p>It is important to us that you find a place where you feel comfortable.  Here are some 

reasons we think that we might be the right orthodontic practice for you:</p>

										<div class="row title-section" id="hours">
											<div class="col-md-12">
												<h3>﻿﻿Increased Hours</h3>
												<p>Each patient is important to Dr. Bates. In order to provide better service, Dr. Bates has 

increased his hours to enable him to spend more time with each patient.  We also have 

evening hours available to meet the needs of those who have strict time constraints 

during the day.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										<div class="row title-section" id="plans">
											<div class="col-md-12">
												<h3>Customized Treatment Plans</h3>
												<p>Each treatment plan is customized for you after we analyze all of the information from 

your exam and determine the best course of action.  Offering braces and Invisalign® 

treatment options, Dr. Bates will work with you to provide the best option for your unique 

needs.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										<div class="row title-section" id="locations">
											<div class="col-md-12">													
												<h3>Convenient Locations</h3>
												<p>We have two convenient locations located in the West End and in Mechanicsville. 

Whether you’re on the West side of Richmond or the East side, we have a location that 

can meet your needs.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										<div class="row title-section" id="service">
											<div class="col-md-12">												
												<h3>Excellent Customer Service</h3>
												<p>When you become a patient, you become a part of our family and are treated the way 

that we treat our family.</p>
												<p>Excellence in treatment alone is not enough. We believe in giving you superior

customer service and want your orthodontic experience to be fantastic. After you start 

treatment, we will call you to check in and provide the doctor's phone number in case of 

emergencies. We do all these things and more to give you the best treatment 

experience possible.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										<div class="row title-section" id="quality">
											<div class="col-md-12">													
												<h3>Highest Quality Materials</h3>
												<p>Excellent treatment demands excellent materials, so we only use the highest quality 

braces and wires. Nearly 100% of the materials that we use have been manufactured in 

the USA.  Dr. Bates is also certified in using Invisalign® and Invisalign TeenTM, the 

highest quality clear aligner system for "invisible" orthodontic treatment.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										<div class="row title-section" id="nopressure">
											<div class="col-md-12">												
												<h3>No Pressure to Start</h3>
												<p>Your first visit to our office is designed to be informative and educational, where we 

discuss your expectations, needs, and treatment options. Dr. Bates will let you know the 

optimal time to begin orthodontic treatment, and if it is appropriate to wait, we will 

suggest annual or semi-annual observation visits until the time is right to begin. We will 

never pressure you to start treatment - only give you our best recommendations to 

ensure the best treatment possible.</p>
